## Projects

### Auto ML Pipeline
- [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/swaraj-khan/AutoML-Data-Pipeline)
- Created a GitHub repo for a project called Auto ML pipeline which automates machine learning tasks including image segmentation, LSTM prediction, and CSV data analysis.
- This pipeline aims to simplify the process of implementing machine learning models for various tasks, providing a seamless experience for researchers and practitioners alike.

### Binary Image Classification with Deep Neural Networks
- [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/swaraj-khan/Deep-Neural-Netwroks/blob/main/2.%20Binary_Classification.pdf)
- Explored image classification using deep neural networks in the "Cat vs. Dog" project, assessing the performance of 2-Layer (72% accuracy) and L-Layer (80% accuracy) neural network models.
- Detailing architecture, implementation, and performance metrics in a Jupyter notebook.
- The future objectives involve experimenting with different architectures, delving into convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and expanding the model to tackle various image classification tasks.

### Autonomous Driving - Car Detection
- [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/swaraj-khan/Deep-Neural-Netwroks/blob/main/Autonomous_driving_application_Car_detection.ipynb)
- Detect objects in a car detection dataset
- Implement non-max suppression to increase accuracy
- Implement intersection over union
- Handle bounding boxes, a type of image annotation popular in deep learning
- Accuracy of 89% on test set for detecting cars 

### Emojify
- [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/swaraj-khan/Deep-Neural-Netwroks/blob/main/Emoji_v3a.ipynb)
- Create an embedding layer in Keras with pre-trained word vectors
- Explain the advantages and disadvantages of the GloVe algorithm
- Build a sentiment classifier using word embeddings
- Build and train a more sophisticated classifier using an LSTM
- Accuracy of 87% on test set

### Deep Learning & Art: Neural Style Transfer
- [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/swaraj-khan/Deep-Neural-Netwroks/blob/main/art-generation-with-neural-style-transfer.ipynb)
- Neural Style Transfer (NST) uses a previously trained convolutional network, and builds on top of that. The idea of using a network trained on a different task and applying it to a new task is called transfer learning.
- Following the original NST paper, we will use the VGG network. Specifically, we'll use VGG-19, a 19-layer version of the VGG network. This model has already been trained on the very large ImageNet database, and thus has learned to recognize a variety of low level features (at the shallower layers) and high level features (at the deeper layers).

### World Port Priority Score Predictor
- [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/swaraj-khan/World-Port-Priority-Score-Predictor)
- EDA of the dataset, handling missing values, feature extraction along with data visualization:
- Plotting ports using geopandas and folium, performed linear regression, tuned the model with hyperparameters and finally evaluated the model.
