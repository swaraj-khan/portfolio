## Experience

### Chatbot Development | Intern @ Nokia | Bangalore | Mar '24 - Till date
- Working for Nokia Bangalore since March 2024.
- Started as an intern and currently working on it.
- Developing a chatbot for the internal teams to assist with log analysis during testing.
- Using NLP, the chatbot helps employees understand log messages by providing suitable answers to their queries.

### Trading Bot | Contribution @ IIMB | Bangalore | Feb ’24 - Till date
- Currently working on building a trading bot built with Python based on Moon’s position
- Working with 10 years historical data from Yahoo Finance
- Full moon impact: Buy/sell trends and popular stocks

### Stroke Prediction | Intern @ Disys | Bangalore | Jul ’23 - Aug ’23
- Built a model from patient database to predict heart stroke.
- Data cleaning, data manipulation, handling missing values
- Feature selection, confusion matrix
- Data visualisation-Matplotlib: correlation matrix and bar graphs
- Algorithms: Random Forest(0.945), Gradient Booster(0.941) & Logistic Regression(0.754)

## Projects

### Auto ML Pipeline
- [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/swaraj-khan/AutoML-Data-Pipeline)
- I created a GitHub repo for a project called Auto ML pipeline which automated machine learning tasks including image segmentation, LSTM prediction, and CSV data analysis.
- This pipeline aimed to simplify the process of implementing machine learning models for various tasks, providing a seamless experience for researchers and practitioners alike.

### Text Mining and Analysis
- [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/swaraj-khan/Shawshank-Redemption-Script-for-NLP)
- Developed a Python-based NLP project analyzing "The Shawshank Redemption" script
- Utilized various NLP techniques including sentiment analysis, word frequency analysis, and cosine similarity
- Visualized character networks and sentiment trends
- Conducted extensive text mining and data cleaning

### Binary Image Classification with Deep Neural Networks
- [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/swaraj-khan/Deep-Neural-Netwroks/blob/main/2.%20Binary_Classification.pdf)
- I explored image classification using deep neural networks in the "Cat vs. Dog" project, assessing the performance of 2-Layer (72% accuracy) and L-Layer (80% accuracy) neural network models.
- Detailed architecture, implementation, and performance metrics in a Jupyter notebook.
- The future objectives involved experimenting with different architectures, delving into convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and expanding the model to tackle various image classification tasks.

### Autonomous Driving - Car Detection
- [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/swaraj-khan/Deep-Neural-Netwroks/blob/main/Autonomous_driving_application_Car_detection.ipynb)
- I detected objects in a car detection dataset
- Implemented non-max suppression to increase accuracy
- Implemented intersection over union
- Handled bounding boxes, a type of image annotation popular in deep learning
- Achieved an accuracy of 89% on the test set for detecting cars 

### Emojify
- [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/swaraj-khan/Deep-Neural-Netwroks/blob/main/Emoji_v3a.ipynb)
- Created an embedding layer in Keras with pre-trained word vectors
- Explained the advantages and disadvantages of the GloVe algorithm
- Built a sentiment classifier using word embeddings
- Built and trained a more sophisticated classifier using an LSTM
- Achieved an accuracy of 87% on the test set

### Deep Learning & Art: Neural Style Transfer
- [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/swaraj-khan/Deep-Neural-Netwroks/blob/main/art-generation-with-neural-style-transfer.ipynb)
- Neural Style Transfer (NST) used a previously trained convolutional network, and built on top of that. The idea of using a network trained on a different task and applying it to a new task is called transfer learning.
- Following the original NST paper, I used the VGG network. Specifically, I used VGG-19, a 19-layer version of the VGG network. This model had already been trained on the very large ImageNet database
